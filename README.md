1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-of-begonia.git
   cd bank-of-begonia
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Flask UI dependencies:

## Troubleshooting

- If you see CORS errors or cannot connect, make sure you are using `http://127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) in both backend and frontend.
- Only one frontend (React or Flask) can run on port 3000 at a time.
- If you get an error about a port being in use, stop the other server or change the port.




## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Frontend/UI**: Flask
- **Storage**: JSON files (easily replaceable with a database)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates

**No AI/chatbot or LLM features included.**

## Integration Tests

### Flask (Python)
To run integration tests for the Flask backend:
```bash
cd flask_frontend
python testing.py
```

### React (Frontend)
To run integration tests for the React frontend:
```bash
cd ui
npm test
```

Integration tests cover key user flows and loading indicators for both backend and frontend.
